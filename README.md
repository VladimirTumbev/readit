## Getting Started <a name ="GettingStarted"></a>   

To get a copy of the project running on your local machine for development and testing purposes you will need to clone the repository into a brand new folder on your machine and run in the terminal in the root folder:
```
npm install
```
After all the dependancies are downloaded ensure that you have MariaDB service up and running and create a database. The default database is readitdb. This can be changed in the config.json file inside the db folder. From the root folder, you need to enter the db folder and run the following commands to init the database and add the migrations and the seeds:
```
cd db/   (to change to the db folder)
../node_modules/.bin/sequelize db:migrate
../node_modules/.bin/sequelize db:seed:all
cd ..  (to change back to the root folder)
```
Locally the app is set up to work on port 3001. to run the app use the command:
```
node app/server.js
or
npm start (from the root folder)
```
In your browser navigate to link:
```
http://localhost:3001/
```
Voal√°!!
### Prerequisites <a name ="Prerequisites"></a>

The only mandatory requirement for installing the project is [Node Js](https://nodejs.org/dist/v8.11.1/node-v8.11.1-x64.msi). The rest of the dependancies are installed via the command: 
```
npm install
```

### Usage <a name ="Usage"></a>

To be able to experience all the features of the app, you will need to register to the app.
Choose a unique username and password, at least 3 characters long and provide an url for an avatar (optional, if omitted it will use the default avatar).
After registering, proceed to log-in with the newly created username and password.

You now have thet ability to create new posts and comment on your or existing posts.
Clicking on your profile will provide you with a summary of your posts and comments.
At this current 1.0.0 version of the application there are only 3 subreadits, however at future versions admins will be able to add aditional tags and subreadits.


## Running the tests

The app has tests that can be run with Mocha.
The terminal command is:

```
npm test (from the root folder of the app)
```
### Break down into end to end tests
